# Jet Images Classification Using DL: Ensemble Model
Jets originate from quarks and gluons present a unique challenge for identification due to their complex, multidimensional structures. This research represents jets as a two-dimensional image of particle clouds, enabling the application of modern computer vision neural network architectures to perform jet tagging.
